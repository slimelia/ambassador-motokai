# ambassador-motokai
A quick fix for the [Motokai](https://github.com/Boldewyn/motokai) motif, created by [Manuel Strehl](https://github.com/Boldewyn), adapted to work on [Ambassador](https://github.com/Ascrod/ambassador).

## Screenshot
![A screenshot of the Motokai motif in use](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c795089-45b3-456a-b618-5ad690071340)
The above screeenshot is utilising the [Dark Moon](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/darkmoon/) theme for Pale Moon.

## Installation
Download `motokai.css`. In Ambassador, go to Ambassador → Preferences → Global Settings → Appearance, scroll to the _Motif_ section, and select the `motokai.css` file as your _Current motif_.

> [!TIP]
> This motif looks particularly good with Lootyhoof's [Dark Moon](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/darkmoon/) theme for Pale Moon! Give it a try!

## Compatibility
This motif _should_ work without issues on Ambassador. Ambassador itself is compatible with [UXP](https://repo.palemoon.org/MoonchildProductions/UXP) browsers, such as [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/) and [Basilisk](https://basilisk-browser.org/).

## License
The motif is licensed under the same license as ChatZilla itself, namely the MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0 and LGPL 2.1. See file LICENSE for details.
